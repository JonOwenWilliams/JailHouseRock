# Jailhouse Rock.

Jailhouse Rock is a site used to advertise a rock concert held within an abandoned prison located in Portsmouth, Kingston. The site will target those who love rock music, including classic rock, rock and roll modern-day rock, and emo rock. Jailhouse Rock will host the best bands spread out over 4 days. The site will also tell people the location and have a selection of images of previous bands throughout the years and a form that will give them the chance to win **Free** merchandise.

## Features of the site.

### Main styles on all pages

The font I chose was a rock and roll style font to stick with the theme that this is a site to advertise a rock concert as a majority of the pages is a dark color should make the text white with a text shadow of red to add contrast from the background colors to the text to make the text stand out a lot more.

the wallpaper I chose to put behind the main page which is only visible when the screen is a certain width or more fits with the theme of the whole website the reason I chose to do this and only let the main content of the page be a certain width is to force the content in the middle of a screen to help the viewers focus on the page.

### navigation links and header
The navigation links are positioned on top of the page to help you navigate your way through the site. there are four pages within the site that you can go to by clicking the links. the mobile version has a hidden navigation link to make the website less cluttered. All links are interactive and respond to hovering when the site is viewed on a desktop, when the links are hovered over an underline shows up under the text.

### footer

The footer has a button link to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (X), and Youtube. Each link loads up the correct social network in a new tab so you never have the leave the main page.

### Hero image and overlay text.

The hero image I used was of a band on stage and the photo was taken with the crowd to show you that this site is made to advertise a music festival. the overlay text tells you the name of the festival as well as a location date and time and also houses a button link that takes you to Google Maps and the location of the festival The button itself has a hover feature that changes the appearance of the button.

### Why choose Jailhouse Rock?

This section was added to tell the targeted audience why they should come to the Jailhouse Rock Festival and all the things it has to offer. the text style changes from the header to the paragraph as the smaller text becomes harder to read with the red text-shadow.

### Three link buttons.

on the bottom of the home page above the footer, I have added 3 link buttons that also take you to the other 3 pages but give a brief description of what each page has to offer.

### The lineup page

The lineup page has been laid out in a collum to help the reader focus on the names of the bands instead of having to look from one side of the screen to the other. I have also implemented the background images all of a similar color to add contrast from the images to the text thus making the text more overpowering than the background images. each section tells you the date the time and what bands will be performing on that specific day.

### The signup page

I have added a large image for the background that sticks with the themes of the site. the form itself is placed in the center of the page. the form itself contains a first and last name field and an email field all of which are required, the form also includes 2 text boxes of different sizes a checkbox section, and finally a submit button. underneath the form is a paragraph element that explains what you will receive by submitting this form.

### The Gallery Page

The gallery page houses all sorts of images linked in with rock concerts the page itself is interactive with different devices (mobile has 1 collum of photos, tablets have 2 columns of photos, and laptops and larger have 3 columns of photos). each photo has an alt text to explain what the image is of.

### All tests performed

when testing the functionality of the website I tests all nav links even the header link to test if they all work as well as testing the 3 button links on the bottom of the index page. I have tested all social media links and made sure they all take you to the correct social media page. I have tested the address button to make sure it takes you to a specific position on Google Maps. I tested all the required elements in the form section and tested if the form was sent to the correct page. Â I tested how the site works on different devices as well as testing it on my own devices such as my phone my tablet my laptop and my PC with an ultrawide monitor.

I ran all the HTML codes through the HTML validator and CSS validator and came up with no issues.

I also ran each page through the lighthouse feature one issue that caught my eye was that the images I was using on the gallery were affecting the performance significantly due to the size of the image files so I used an online image compressor to compress the images to increase performance. the site I used to compress the images was [imagecompresson. com](https://imagecompressor.com/)
