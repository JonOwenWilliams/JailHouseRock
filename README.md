## Features of the site.

### Main styles on all pages

The fonts i chose were a rock and roll style font to stick with the theme that this is a site to advertise a rock concert as a majority of the pages is a dark colour i shoes to make the text white with a text shadow of red to add contrast from the background colours to the text to make the text stand out alot more.

the wallpaper i chose to put behind the main page which is only visible when the screen is a certain width or more fits with the theme of the whole website the reason i chose to do this and only let the main content of the page be a certain width is to force the content in the middle of a screen to help te viewers focus on the page.

### navigation links and header
The navigation links are positioned ontop of the page to help you navigate your way through the site. there are four pages within the site that you can go to by clicking the links. the mobile verson has a hidden navigating link to make the website less cluttered. all links are interactive and respond to hovering when the site is viewed on a desktop, when the links are hovered over an underline shows up under the text.

### Hero image and overlay text.

The hero image I used was of a band on stage and the photo was taken winthin the crowd to show you that this site is made to advertise a music festival. the overlay text tells you the name of the festival aswell as a the location the date and time and also houses a button link that take you to google maps and the location of the fesival the button itself has a hover feature that chanages the aperance of the button.

### Why choose jail house rock.

This section was added to tell the targeted audience why they should come to the Jailhouse Rock festival and all the tings it has to offer. the text style changs from the header to the paragraph as the smaller text becomes harder to read with the red text shadow.

### The lineup page

The lineup ppage has be layed out in a collum to help the reader focus on the names of the bands insted of them having to look from one side of the screen to the other. i have also implamented the background images all of a similar colour to add contrast from the images to the text and thus making the the text more overpowerig than the background images. each section tells you the date the time and what bands will be performing on that specific day.
